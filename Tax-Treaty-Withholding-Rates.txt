                                         services, business profits, etc.), domestic law controls. The

                                         treaty countries is generally 15%. For technical and other
                                         service fees paid to a non-resident company, the withholding
                                         tax rate is 17%. Technical service fees paid to non-resident
                                         individuals are subject to withholding tax at 20%. Therefore,
                                         the general domestic law withholding rate for Singapore-
                                         sourced fees paid to non-residents for technical services is
