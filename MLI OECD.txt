MULTILATERAL CONVENTION
TO IMPLEMENT TAX TREATY RELATED MEASURES
TO PREVENT BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING

The Parties to this Convention,
Recognising that governments lose substantial corporate tax revenue because of aggressive
international tax planning that has the effect of artificially shifting profits to locations where they are
subject to non-taxation or reduced taxation;
Mindful that base erosion and profit shifting (hereinafter referred to as “BEPS”) is a pressing issue
not only for industrialised countries but also for emerging economies and developing countries;
Recognising the importance of ensuring that profits are taxed where substantive economic activities
generating the profits are carried out and where value is created;
Welcoming the package of measures developed under the OECD/G20 BEPS project (hereinafter
referred to as the “OECD/G20 BEPS package”);
Noting that the OECD/G20 BEPS package included tax treaty-related measures to address certain
hybrid mismatch arrangements, prevent treaty abuse, address artificial avoidance of permanent
establishment status, and improve dispute resolution;
Conscious of the need to ensure swift, co-ordinated and consistent implementation of the treatyrelated BEPS measures in a multilateral context;
Noting the need to ensure that existing agreements for the avoidance of double taxation on income
are interpreted to eliminate double taxation with respect to the taxes covered by those agreements without
creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including
through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in those agreements for the
indirect benefit of residents of third jurisdictions);
Recognising the need for an effective mechanism to implement agreed changes in a synchronised
and efficient manner across the network of existing agreements for the avoidance of double taxation on
income without the need to bilaterally renegotiate each such agreement;
Have agreed as follows:

1

PART I.

PART II.
HYBRID MISMATCHES
Article 3 - Transparent Entities
1.
For the purposes of a Covered Tax Agreement, income derived by or through an entity or
arrangement that is treated as wholly or partly fiscally transparent under the tax law of either Contracting
Jurisdiction shall be considered to be income of a resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction but only to the
extent that the income is treated, for purposes of taxation by that Contracting Jurisdiction, as the income of
a resident of that Contracting Jurisdiction.
2.
Provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that require a Contracting Jurisdiction to exempt from
income tax or provide a deduction or credit equal to the income tax paid with respect to income derived by
a resident of that Contracting Jurisdiction which may be taxed in the other Contracting Jurisdiction
according to the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement shall not apply to the extent that such
provisions allow taxation by that other Contracting Jurisdiction solely because the income is also income
derived by a resident of that other Contracting Jurisdiction.
3.
With respect to Covered Tax Agreements for which one or more Parties has made the reservation
described in subparagraph a) of paragraph 3 of Article 11 (Application of Tax Agreements to Restrict a
Party’s Right to Tax its Own Residents), the following sentence will be added at the end of paragraph 1:
“In no case shall the provisions of this paragraph be construed to affect a Contracting Jurisdiction’s right to
tax the residents of that Contracting Jurisdiction.”
4.
Paragraph 1 (as it may be modified by paragraph 3) shall apply in place of or in the absence of
provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement to the extent that they address whether income derived by or
through entities or arrangements that are treated as fiscally transparent under the tax law of either
Contracting Jurisdiction (whether through a general rule or by identifying in detail the treatment of specific
fact patterns and types of entities or arrangements) shall be treated as income of a resident of a Contracting
Jurisdiction.
5.

A Party may reserve the right:
a)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements;

b)

for paragraph 1 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that already contain a provision
described in paragraph 4;

c)

for paragraph 1 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that already contain a provision
described in paragraph 4 which denies treaty benefits in the case of income derived by or
through an entity or arrangement established in a third jurisdiction;

d)

for paragraph 1 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that already contain a provision
described in paragraph 4 which identifies in detail the treatment of specific fact patterns and
types of entities or arrangements;

e)

for paragraph 1 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that already contain a provision
described in paragraph 4 which identifies in detail the treatment of specific fact patterns and
types of entities or arrangements and denies treaty benefits in the case of income derived by or
through an entity or arrangement established in a third jurisdiction;

3

f)

for paragraph 2 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements;

g)

for paragraph 1 to apply only to its Covered Tax Agreements that already contain a provision
described in paragraph 4 which identifies in detail the treatment of specific fact patterns and
types of entities or arrangements.

6.
Each Party that has not made a reservation described in subparagraph a) or b) of paragraph 5 shall
notify the Depositary of whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements contains a provision described in
paragraph 4 that is not subject to a reservation under subparagraphs c) through e) of paragraph 5, and if so,
the article and paragraph number of each such provision. In the case of a Party that has made the
reservation described in subparagraph g) of paragraph 5, the notification pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall be limited to Covered Tax Agreements that are subject to that reservation. Where all Contracting
Jurisdictions have made such a notification with respect to a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement, that
provision shall be replaced by the provisions of paragraph 1 (as it may be modified by paragraph 3) to the
extent provided in paragraph 4. In other cases, paragraph 1 (as it may be modified by paragraph 3) shall
supersede the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement only to the extent that those provisions are
incompatible with paragraph 1 (as it may be modified by paragraph 3).

Article 4 – Dual Resident Entities
1.
Where by reason of the provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement a person other than an individual is
a resident of more than one Contracting Jurisdiction, the competent authorities of the Contracting
Jurisdictions shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting Jurisdiction of which such
person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Covered Tax Agreement, having regard to
its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other
relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or
exemption from tax provided by the Covered Tax Agreement except to the extent and in such manner as
may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions.
2.
Paragraph 1 shall apply in place of or in the absence of provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that
provide rules for determining whether a person other than an individual shall be treated as a resident of one
of the Contracting Jurisdictions in cases in which that person would otherwise be treated as a resident of
more than one Contracting Jurisdiction. Paragraph 1 shall not apply, however, to provisions of a Covered
Tax Agreement specifically addressing the residence of companies participating in dual-listed company
arrangements.
3.

A Party may reserve the right:
a)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements;

b)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that already address
cases where a person other than an individual is a resident of more than one Contracting
Jurisdiction by requiring the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions to
endeavour to reach mutual agreement on a single Contracting Jurisdiction of residence;

c)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that already address
cases where a person other than an individual is a resident of more than one Contracting
Jurisdiction by denying treaty benefits without requiring the competent authorities of the
Contracting Jurisdictions to endeavour to reach mutual agreement on a single Contracting
Jurisdiction of residence;
4

d)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that already address
cases where a person other than an individual is a resident of more than one Contracting
Jurisdiction by requiring the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions to
endeavour to reach mutual agreement on a single Contracting Jurisdiction of residence, and
that set out the treatment of that person under the Covered Tax Agreement where such an
agreement cannot be reached;

e)

to replace the last sentence of paragraph 1 with the following text for the purposes of its
Covered Tax Agreements: “In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be
entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by the Covered Tax Agreement.”;

f)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements with Parties that
have made the reservation described in subparagraph e).

4.
Each Party that has not made a reservation described in subparagraph a) of paragraph 3 shall notify
the Depositary of whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements contains a provision described in paragraph
2 that is not subject to a reservation under subparagraphs b) through d) of paragraph 3, and if so, the article
and paragraph number of each such provision. Where all Contracting Jurisdictions have made such a
notification with respect to a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement, that provision shall be replaced by
the provisions of paragraph 1. In other cases, paragraph 1 shall supersede the provisions of the Covered
Tax Agreement only to the extent that those provisions are incompatible with paragraph 1.

Article 5 – Application of Methods for Elimination of Double Taxation
1.
A Party may choose to apply either paragraphs 2 and 3 (Option A), paragraphs 4 and 5 (Option B),
or paragraphs 6 and 7 (Option C), or may choose to apply none of the Options. Where each Contracting
Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax Agreement chooses a different Option (or where one Contracting
Jurisdiction chooses to apply an Option and the other chooses to apply none of the Options), the Option
chosen by each Contracting Jurisdiction shall apply with respect to its own residents.
Option A
2.
Provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that would otherwise exempt income derived or capital
owned by a resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction from tax in that Contracting Jurisdiction for the purpose
of eliminating double taxation shall not apply where the other Contracting Jurisdiction applies the
provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement to exempt such income or capital from tax or to limit the rate at
which such income or capital may be taxed. In the latter case, the first-mentioned Contracting Jurisdiction
shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income or capital of that resident an amount equal to the tax
paid in that other Contracting Jurisdiction. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax,
as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to such items of income or capital which
may be taxed in that other Contracting Jurisdiction.
3.
Paragraph 2 shall apply to a Covered Tax Agreement that would otherwise require a Contracting
Jurisdiction to exempt income or capital described in that paragraph.
Option B
4.
Provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that would otherwise exempt income derived by a resident
of a Contracting Jurisdiction from tax in that Contracting Jurisdiction for the purpose of eliminating double
taxation because such income is treated as a dividend by that Contracting Jurisdiction shall not apply
5

where such income gives rise to a deduction for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of a resident
of the other Contracting Jurisdiction under the laws of that other Contracting Jurisdiction. In such case, the
first-mentioned Contracting Jurisdiction shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that
resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in that other Contracting Jurisdiction. Such deduction shall
not, however, exceed that part of the income tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is
attributable to such income which may be taxed in that other Contracting Jurisdiction.
5.
Paragraph 4 shall apply to a Covered Tax Agreement that would otherwise require a Contracting
Jurisdiction to exempt income described in that paragraph.
Option C
6.

a)

Where a resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction derives income or owns capital which may be
taxed in the other Contracting Jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of a Covered Tax
Agreement (except to the extent that these provisions allow taxation by that other Contracting
Jurisdiction solely because the income is also income derived by a resident of that other
Contracting Jurisdiction), the first-mentioned Contracting Jurisdiction shall allow:
i)

as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident, an amount equal to the
income tax paid in that other Contracting Jurisdiction;

ii)

as a deduction from the tax on the capital of that resident, an amount equal to the capital
tax paid in that other Contracting Jurisdiction.

Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax or capital tax, as
computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income or the capital
which may be taxed in that other Contracting Jurisdiction.
b)

Where in accordance with any provision of the Covered Tax Agreement income derived or
capital owned by a resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction is exempt from tax in that
Contracting Jurisdiction, such Contracting Jurisdiction may nevertheless, in calculating the
amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, take into account the
exempted income or capital.

7.
Paragraph 6 shall apply in place of provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that, for purposes of
eliminating double taxation, require a Contracting Jurisdiction to exempt from tax in that Contracting
Jurisdiction income derived or capital owned by a resident of that Contracting Jurisdiction which, in
accordance with the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement, may be taxed in the other Contracting
Jurisdiction.
8.
A Party that does not choose to apply an Option under paragraph 1 may reserve the right for the
entirety of this Article not to apply with respect to one or more identified Covered Tax Agreements (or
with respect to all of its Covered Tax Agreements).
9.
A Party that does not choose to apply Option C may reserve the right, with respect to one or more
identified Covered Tax Agreements (or with respect to all of its Covered Tax Agreements), not to permit
the other Contracting Jurisdiction(s) to apply Option C.
10. Each Party that chooses to apply an Option under paragraph 1 shall notify the Depositary of its
choice of Option. Such notification shall also include:

6

a)

in the case of a Party that chooses to apply Option A, the list of its Covered Tax Agreements
which contain a provision described in paragraph 3, as well as the article and paragraph
number of each such provision;

b)

in the case of a Party that chooses to apply Option B, the list of its Covered Tax Agreements
which contain a provision described in paragraph 5, as well as the article and paragraph
number of each such provision;

c)

in the case of a Party that chooses to apply Option C, the list of its Covered Tax Agreements
which contain a provision described in paragraph 7, as well as the article and paragraph
number of each such provision.

An Option shall apply with respect to a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement only where the Party that
has chosen to apply that Option has made such a notification with respect to that provision.

7

PART III.
TREATY ABUSE
Article 6 – Purpose of a Covered Tax Agreement
1.

A Covered Tax Agreement shall be modified to include the following preamble text:
“Intending to eliminate double taxation with respect to the taxes covered by this agreement without
creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance
(including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in this
agreement for the indirect benefit of residents of third jurisdictions),”.

2.
The text described in paragraph 1 shall be included in a Covered Tax Agreement in place of or in the
absence of preamble language of the Covered Tax Agreement referring to an intent to eliminate double
taxation, whether or not that language also refers to the intent not to create opportunities for non-taxation
or reduced taxation.
3.
A Party may also choose to include the following preamble text with respect to its Covered Tax
Agreements that do not contain preamble language referring to a desire to develop an economic
relationship or to enhance co-operation in tax matters:
“Desiring to further develop their economic relationship and to enhance their co-operation in tax
matters,”.
4.
A Party may reserve the right for paragraph 1 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that
already contain preamble language describing the intent of the Contracting Jurisdictions to eliminate
double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation, whether that language
is limited to cases of tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at
obtaining reliefs provided in the Covered Tax Agreement for the indirect benefit of residents of third
jurisdictions) or applies more broadly.
5.
Each Party shall notify the Depositary of whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements, other than
those that are within the scope of a reservation under paragraph 4, contains preamble language described in
paragraph 2, and if so, the text of the relevant preambular paragraph. Where all Contracting Jurisdictions
have made such a notification with respect to that preamble language, such preamble language shall be
replaced by the text described in paragraph 1. In other cases, the text described in paragraph 1 shall be
included in addition to the existing preamble language.
6.
Each Party that chooses to apply paragraph 3 shall notify the Depositary of its choice. Such
notification shall also include the list of its Covered Tax Agreements that do not already contain preamble
language referring to a desire to develop an economic relationship or to enhance co-operation in tax
matters. The text described in paragraph 3 shall be included in a Covered Tax Agreement only where all
Contracting Jurisdictions have chosen to apply that paragraph and have made such a notification with
respect to the Covered Tax Agreement.

Article 7 – Prevention of Treaty Abuse
1.
Notwithstanding any provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement, a benefit under the Covered Tax
Agreement shall not be granted in respect of an item of income or capital if it is reasonable to conclude,
8

having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal
purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is
established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and
purpose of the relevant provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement.
2.
Paragraph 1 shall apply in place of or in the absence of provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that
deny all or part of the benefits that would otherwise be provided under the Covered Tax Agreement where
the principal purpose or one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction, or of any person
concerned with an arrangement or transaction, was to obtain those benefits.
3.
A Party that has not made the reservation described in subparagraph a) of paragraph 15 may also
choose to apply paragraph 4 with respect to its Covered Tax Agreements.
4.
Where a benefit under a Covered Tax Agreement is denied to a person under provisions of the
Covered Tax Agreement (as it may be modified by this Convention) that deny all or part of the benefits
that would otherwise be provided under the Covered Tax Agreement where the principal purpose or one of
the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction, or of any person concerned with an arrangement
or transaction, was to obtain those benefits, the competent authority of the Contracting Jurisdiction that
would otherwise have granted this benefit shall nevertheless treat that person as being entitled to this
benefit, or to different benefits with respect to a specific item of income or capital, if such competent
authority, upon request from that person and after consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances,
determines that such benefits would have been granted to that person in the absence of the transaction or
arrangement. The competent authority of the Contracting Jurisdiction to which a request has been made
under this paragraph by a resident of the other Contracting Jurisdiction shall consult with the competent
authority of that other Contracting Jurisdiction before rejecting the request.
5.
Paragraph 4 shall apply to provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement (as it may be modified by this
Convention) that deny all or part of the benefits that would otherwise be provided under the Covered Tax
Agreement where the principal purpose or one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction,
or of any person concerned with an arrangement or transaction, was to obtain those benefits.
6.
A Party may also choose to apply the provisions contained in paragraphs 8 through 13 (hereinafter
referred to as the “Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision”) to its Covered Tax Agreements by
making the notification described in subparagraph c) of paragraph 17. The Simplified Limitation on
Benefits Provision shall apply with respect to a Covered Tax Agreement only where all Contracting
Jurisdictions have chosen to apply it.
7.
In cases where some but not all of the Contracting Jurisdictions to a Covered Tax Agreement choose
to apply the Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision pursuant to paragraph 6, then, notwithstanding the
provisions of that paragraph, the Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision shall apply with respect to
the granting of benefits under the Covered Tax Agreement:
a)

by all Contracting Jurisdictions, if all of the Contracting Jurisdictions that do not choose
pursuant to paragraph 6 to apply the Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision agree to such
application by choosing to apply this subparagraph and notifying the Depositary accordingly;
or

b)

only by the Contracting Jurisdictions that choose to apply the Simplified Limitation on
Benefits Provision, if all of the Contracting Jurisdictions that do not choose pursuant to
paragraph 6 to apply the Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision agree to such application
by choosing to apply this subparagraph and notifying the Depositary accordingly.

9

Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision
8.
Except as otherwise provided in the Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision, a resident of a
Contracting Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax Agreement shall not be entitled to a benefit that would otherwise
be accorded by the Covered Tax Agreement, other than a benefit under provisions of the Covered Tax
Agreement:
a)

which determine the residence of a person other than an individual which is a resident of more
than one Contracting Jurisdiction by reason of provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement that
define a resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction;

b)

which provide that a Contracting Jurisdiction will grant to an enterprise of that Contracting
Jurisdiction a corresponding adjustment following an initial adjustment made by the other
Contacting Jurisdiction, in accordance with the Covered Tax Agreement, to the amount of tax
charged in the first-mentioned Contracting Jurisdiction on the profits of an associated
enterprise; or

c)

which allow residents of a Contracting Jurisdiction to request that the competent authority of
that Contracting Jurisdiction consider cases of taxation not in accordance with the Covered
Tax Agreement,

unless such resident is a “qualified person”, as defined in paragraph 9 at the time that the benefit would be
accorded.
9.
A resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax Agreement shall be a qualified person at a
time when a benefit would otherwise be accorded by the Covered Tax Agreement if, at that time, the
resident is:
a)

an individual;

b)

that Contracting Jurisdiction, or a political subdivision or local authority thereof, or an agency
or instrumentality of any such Contracting Jurisdiction, political subdivision or local
authority;

c)

a company or other entity, if the principal class of its shares is regularly traded on one or more
recognised stock exchanges;

d)

a person, other than an individual, that:
i)

is a non-profit organisation of a type that is agreed to by the Contracting Jurisdictions
through an exchange of diplomatic notes; or

ii)

is an entity or arrangement established in that Contracting Jurisdiction that is treated as
a separate person under the taxation laws of that Contracting Jurisdiction and:
A)

that is established and operated exclusively or almost exclusively to administer or
provide retirement benefits and ancillary or incidental benefits to individuals and
that is regulated as such by that Contracting Jurisdiction or one of its political
subdivisions or local authorities; or

B)

that is established and operated exclusively or almost exclusively to invest funds
for the benefit of entities or arrangements referred to in subdivision A);
10

10.

e)

a person other than an individual, if, on at least half the days of a twelve-month period that
includes the time when the benefit would otherwise be accorded, persons who are residents of
that Contracting Jurisdiction and that are entitled to benefits of the Covered Tax Agreement
under subparagraphs a) to d) own, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the shares of
the person.

a)

A resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax Agreement will be entitled to
benefits of the Covered Tax Agreement with respect to an item of income derived from the
other Contracting Jurisdiction, regardless of whether the resident is a qualified person, if the
resident is engaged in the active conduct of a business in the first-mentioned Contracting
Jurisdiction, and the income derived from the other Contracting Jurisdiction emanates from, or
is incidental to, that business. For purposes of the Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision,
the term “active conduct of a business” shall not include the following activities or any
combination thereof:
i)

operating as a holding company;

ii)

providing overall supervision or administration of a group of companies;

iii)

providing group financing (including cash pooling); or

iv)

making or managing investments, unless these activities are carried on by a bank,
insurance company or registered securities dealer in the ordinary course of its business
as such.

b)

If a resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax Agreement derives an item of
income from a business activity conducted by that resident in the other Contracting
Jurisdiction, or derives an item of income arising in the other Contracting Jurisdiction from a
connected person, the conditions described in subparagraph a) shall be considered to be
satisfied with respect to such item only if the business activity carried on by the resident in the
first-mentioned Contracting Jurisdiction to which the item is related is substantial in relation
to the same activity or a complementary business activity carried on by the resident or such
connected person in the other Contracting Jurisdiction. Whether a business activity is
substantial for the purposes of this subparagraph shall be determined based on all the facts and
circumstances.

c)

For purposes of applying this paragraph, activities conducted by connected persons with
respect to a resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax Agreement shall be
deemed to be conducted by such resident.

11. A resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax Agreement that is not a qualified person
shall also be entitled to a benefit that would otherwise be accorded by the Covered Tax Agreement with
respect to an item of income if, on at least half of the days of any twelve-month period that includes the
time when the benefit would otherwise be accorded, persons that are equivalent beneficiaries own, directly
or indirectly, at least 75 per cent of the beneficial interests of the resident.
12. If a resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax Agreement is neither a qualified person
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 9, nor entitled to benefits under paragraph 10 or 11, the competent
authority of the other Contracting Jurisdiction may, nevertheless, grant the benefits of the Covered Tax
Agreement, or benefits with respect to a specific item of income, taking into account the object and
purpose of the Covered Tax Agreement, but only if such resident demonstrates to the satisfaction of such
competent authority that neither its establishment, acquisition or maintenance, nor the conduct of its
11

operations, had as one of its principal purposes the obtaining of benefits under the Covered Tax
Agreement. Before either granting or denying a request made under this paragraph by a resident of a
Contracting Jurisdiction, the competent authority of the other Contracting Jurisdiction to which the request
has been made shall consult with the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting Jurisdiction.
13.

For the purposes of the Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision:
a)

the term “recognised stock exchange” means:
i)

any stock exchange established and regulated as such under the laws of either
Contracting Jurisdiction; and

ii)

any other stock exchange agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting
Jurisdictions;

b)

the term “principal class of shares” means the class or classes of shares of a company which
represents the majority of the aggregate vote and value of the company or the class or classes
of beneficial interests of an entity which represents in the aggregate a majority of the
aggregate vote and value of the entity;

c)

the term “equivalent beneficiary” means any person who would be entitled to benefits with
respect to an item of income accorded by a Contracting Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax
Agreement under the domestic law of that Contracting Jurisdiction, the Covered Tax
Agreement or any other international instrument which are equivalent to, or more favourable
than, benefits to be accorded to that item of income under the Covered Tax Agreement; for the
purposes of determining whether a person is an equivalent beneficiary with respect to
dividends, the person shall be deemed to hold the same capital of the company paying the
dividends as such capital the company claiming the benefit with respect to the dividends
holds;

d)

with respect to entities that are not companies, the term “shares” means interests that are
comparable to shares;

e)

two persons shall be “connected persons” if one owns, directly or indirectly, at least 50
per cent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent
of the aggregate vote and value of the company's shares) or another person owns, directly or
indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interest (or, in the case of a company, at least
50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company's shares) in each person; in any
case, a person shall be connected to another if, based on all the relevant facts and
circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same person or
persons.

14. The Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision shall apply in place of or in the absence of
provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that would limit the benefits of the Covered Tax Agreement (or
that would limit benefits other than a benefit under the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement relating
to residence, associated enterprises or non-discrimination or a benefit that is not restricted solely to
residents of a Contracting Jurisdiction) only to a resident that qualifies for such benefits by meeting one or
more categorical tests.
15.

A Party may reserve the right:

12

a)

for paragraph 1 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements on the basis that it intends to
adopt a combination of a detailed limitation on benefits provision and either rules to address
conduit financing structures or a principal purpose test, thereby meeting the minimum
standard for preventing treaty abuse under the OECD/G20 BEPS package; in such cases, the
Contracting Jurisdictions shall endeavour to reach a mutually satisfactory solution which
meets the minimum standard;

b)

for paragraph 1 (and paragraph 4, in the case of a Party that has chosen to apply that
paragraph) not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that already contain provisions that
deny all of the benefits that would otherwise be provided under the Covered Tax Agreement
where the principal purpose or one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or
transaction, or of any person concerned with an arrangement or transaction, was to obtain
those benefits;

c)

for the Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision not to apply to its Covered Tax
Agreements that already contain the provisions described in paragraph 14.

16. Except where the Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision applies with respect to the granting of
benefits under a Covered Tax Agreement by one or more Parties pursuant to paragraph 7, a Party that
chooses pursuant to paragraph 6 to apply the Simplified Limitation on Benefits Provision may reserve the
right for the entirety of this Article not to apply with respect to its Covered Tax Agreements for which one
or more of the other Contracting Jurisdictions has not chosen to apply the Simplified Limitation on
Benefits Provision. In such cases, the Contracting Jurisdictions shall endeavour to reach a mutually
satisfactory solution which meets the minimum standard for preventing treaty abuse under the OECD/G20
BEPS package.
17.

a)

Each Party that has not made the reservation described in subparagraph a) of paragraph 15
shall notify the Depositary of whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements that is not subject
to a reservation described in subparagraph b) of paragraph 15 contains a provision described
in paragraph 2, and if so, the article and paragraph number of each such provision. Where all
Contracting Jurisdictions have made such a notification with respect to a provision of a
Covered Tax Agreement, that provision shall be replaced by the provisions of paragraph 1
(and where applicable, paragraph 4). In other cases, paragraph 1 (and where applicable,
paragraph 4) shall supersede the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement only to the extent
that those provisions are incompatible with paragraph 1 (and where applicable, paragraph 4).

Principally from Immovable Property
1.
Provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement providing that gains derived by a resident of a Contracting
Jurisdiction from the alienation of shares or other rights of participation in an entity may be taxed in the
other Contracting Jurisdiction provided that these shares or rights derived more than a certain part of their
value from immovable property (real property) situated in that other Contracting Jurisdiction (or provided
that more than a certain part of the property of the entity consists of such immovable property (real
property)):
a)

shall apply if the relevant value threshold is met at any time during the 365 days preceding the
alienation; and

b)

shall apply to shares or comparable interests, such as interests in a partnership or trust (to the

property) situated in that other Contracting Jurisdiction, or provided that more than a certain part of the
property of the entity consists of such immovable property (real property).
6.

Article 10 – Anti-abuse Rule for Permanent Establishments Situated in Third Jurisdictions
1.

Where:
a)

an enterprise of a Contracting Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax Agreement derives income from
the other Contracting Jurisdiction and the first-mentioned Contracting Jurisdiction treats such
income as attributable to a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in a third
jurisdiction; and

b)

the profits attributable to that permanent establishment are exempt from tax in the firstmentioned Contracting Jurisdiction,

the benefits of the Covered Tax Agreement shall not apply to any item of income on which the tax in the
third jurisdiction is less than 60 per cent of the tax that would be imposed in the first-mentioned
Contracting Jurisdiction on that item of income if that permanent establishment were situated in the firstmentioned Contracting Jurisdiction. In such a case, any income to which the provisions of this paragraph
apply shall remain taxable according to the domestic law of the other Contracting Jurisdiction,
notwithstanding any other provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement.
2.
Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the income derived from the other Contracting Jurisdiction described
in paragraph 1 is derived in connection with or is incidental to the active conduct of a business carried on
through the permanent establishment (other than the business of making, managing or simply holding
investments for the enterprise’s own account, unless these activities are banking, insurance or securities
activities carried on by a bank, insurance enterprise or registered securities dealer, respectively).

16

3.
If benefits under a Covered Tax Agreement are denied pursuant to paragraph 1 with respect to an
item of income derived by a resident of a Contracting Jurisdiction, the competent authority of the other
Contracting Jurisdiction may, nevertheless, grant these benefits with respect to that item of income if, in
response to a request by such resident, such competent authority determines that granting such benefits is
justified in light of the reasons such resident did not satisfy the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2. The
competent authority of the Contracting Jurisdiction to which a request has been made under the preceding
sentence by a resident of the other Contracting Jurisdiction shall consult with the competent authority of
that other Contracting Jurisdiction before either granting or denying the request.
4.
Paragraphs 1 through 3 shall apply in place of or in the absence of provisions of a Covered Tax
Agreement that deny or limit benefits that would otherwise be granted to an enterprise of a Contracting
Jurisdiction which derives income from the other Contracting Jurisdiction that is attributable to a
permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in a third jurisdiction.
5.

A Party may reserve the right:
a)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements;

b)

notify the Depositary of whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements contains a provision described in
paragraph 4, and if so, the article and paragraph number of each such provision. Where all Contracting
Jurisdictions have made such a notification with respect to a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement, that
provision shall be replaced by the provisions of paragraphs 1 through 3. In other cases, paragraphs 1
through 3 shall supersede the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement only to the extent that those
provisions are incompatible with those paragraphs.

Article 11 – Application of Tax Agreements to Restrict a Party’s Right to Tax its Own Residents
1.
A Covered Tax Agreement shall not affect the taxation by a Contracting Jurisdiction of its residents,
except with respect to the benefits granted under provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement:
a)

which require that Contracting Jurisdiction to grant to an enterprise of that Contracting
Jurisdiction a correlative or corresponding adjustment following an initial adjustment made by
the other Contracting Jurisdiction, in accordance with the Covered Tax Agreement, to the
amount of tax charged in the first-mentioned Contracting Jurisdiction on the profits of a
permanent establishment of the enterprise or the profits of an associated enterprise;

b)

which may affect how that Contracting Jurisdiction taxes an individual who is a resident of
that Contracting Jurisdiction if that individual derives income in respect of services rendered
to the other Contracting Jurisdiction or a political subdivision or local authority or other
comparable body thereof;

c)

which may affect how that Contracting Jurisdiction taxes an individual who is a resident of
that Contracting Jurisdiction if that individual is also a student, business apprentice or trainee,
17

or a teacher, professor, lecturer, instructor, researcher or research scholar who meets the
conditions of the Covered Tax Agreement;
d)

which require that Contracting Jurisdiction to provide a tax credit or tax exemption to
residents of that Contracting Jurisdiction with respect to the income that the other Contracting
Jurisdiction may tax in accordance with the Covered Tax Agreement (including profits that
are attributable to a permanent establishment situated in that other Contracting Jurisdiction in
accordance with the Covered Tax Agreement);

e)

which protect residents of that Contracting Jurisdiction against certain discriminatory taxation
practices by that Contracting Jurisdiction;

f)

which allow residents of that Contracting Jurisdiction to request that the competent authority
of that or either Contracting Jurisdiction consider cases of taxation not in accordance with the
Covered Tax Agreement;

g)

which may affect how that Contracting Jurisdiction taxes an individual who is a resident of
that Contracting Jurisdiction when that individual is a member of a diplomatic mission,
government mission or consular post of the other Contracting Jurisdiction;

h)

which provide that pensions or other payments made under the social security legislation of
the other Contracting Jurisdiction shall be taxable only in that other Contracting Jurisdiction;

i)

which provide that pensions and similar payments, annuities, alimony payments or other
maintenance payments arising in the other Contracting Jurisdiction shall be taxable only in
that other Contracting Jurisdiction; or

j)

which otherwise expressly limit a Contracting Jurisdiction’s right to tax its own residents or
provide expressly that the Contracting Jurisdiction in which an item of income arises has the
exclusive right to tax that item of income.

2.
Paragraph 1 shall apply in place of or in the absence of provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement
stating that the Covered Tax Agreement would not affect the taxation by a Contracting Jurisdiction of its
residents.
3.

A Party may reserve the right:
a)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements;

b)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that already contain
the provisions described in paragraph 2.

4.
Each Party that has not made the reservation described in subparagraph a) or b) of paragraph 3 shall
notify the Depositary of whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements contains a provision described in
paragraph 2, and if so, the article and paragraph number of each such provision. Where all Contracting
Jurisdictions have made such a notification with respect to a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement, that
provision shall be replaced by the provisions of paragraph 1. In other cases, paragraph 1 shall supersede the
provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement only to the extent that those provisions are incompatible with
paragraph 1.

PART IV.
AVOIDANCE OF PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT STATUS
Article 12 – Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status through Commissionnaire
Arrangements and Similar Strategies
1.
Notwithstanding the provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that define the term “permanent
establishment”, but subject to paragraph 2, where a person is acting in a Contracting Jurisdiction to a
Covered Tax Agreement on behalf of an enterprise and, in doing so, habitually concludes contracts, or
habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded
without material modification by the enterprise, and these contracts are:
a)

in the name of the enterprise; or

b)

for the transfer of the ownership of, or for the granting of the right to use, property owned by
that enterprise or that the enterprise has the right to use; or

c)

for the provision of services by that enterprise,

that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that Contracting Jurisdiction in
respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise unless these activities, if they were
exercised by the enterprise through a fixed place of business of that enterprise situated in that Contracting
Jurisdiction, would not cause that fixed place of business to be deemed to constitute a permanent
establishment under the definition of permanent establishment included in the Covered Tax Agreement (as
it may be modified by this Convention).
2.
Paragraph 1 shall not apply where the person acting in a Contracting Jurisdiction to a Covered Tax
Agreement on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting Jurisdiction carries on business in the firstmentioned Contracting Jurisdiction as an independent agent and acts for the enterprise in the ordinary
course of that business. Where, however, a person acts exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of one
or more enterprises to which it is closely related, that person shall not be considered to be an independent
agent within the meaning of this paragraph with respect to any such enterprise.
3.

a)

Paragraph 1 shall apply in place of provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that describe the
conditions under which an enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a
Contracting Jurisdiction (or a person shall be deemed to be a permanent establishment in a
Contracting Jurisdiction) in respect of an activity which a person other than an agent of an
independent status undertakes for the enterprise, but only to the extent that such provisions
address the situation in which such person has, and habitually exercises, in that Contracting
Jurisdiction an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise.

b)

Paragraph 2 shall apply in place of provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that provide that
an enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting
Jurisdiction in respect of an activity which an agent of an independent status undertakes for
the enterprise.

4.
A Party may reserve the right for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax
Agreements.
5.
Each Party that has not made a reservation described in paragraph 4 shall notify the Depositary of
whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements contains a provision described in subparagraph a) of
19

paragraph 3, as well as the article and paragraph number of each such provision. Paragraph 1 shall apply
with respect to a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement only where all Contracting Jurisdictions have
made a notification with respect to that provision.
6.
Each Party that has not made a reservation described in paragraph 4 shall notify the Depositary of
whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements contains a provision described in subparagraph b) of
paragraph 3, as well as the article and paragraph number of each such provision. Paragraph 2 shall apply
with respect to a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement only where all Contracting Jurisdictions have
made such a notification with respect to that provision.

establishment”, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include:
a)

the activities specifically listed in the Covered Tax Agreement (prior to modification by this
Convention) as activities deemed not to constitute a permanent establishment, whether or not
that exception from permanent establishment status is contingent on the activity being of a
preparatory or auxiliary character;

b)

the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the
enterprise, any activity not described in subparagraph a);

c)

the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities
mentioned in subparagraphs a) and b),

provided that such activity or, in the case of subparagraph c), the overall activity of the fixed place of
business, is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.
Option B
3.
Notwithstanding the provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that define the term “permanent
establishment”, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include:
a)

the activities specifically listed in the Covered Tax Agreement (prior to modification by this
Convention) as activities deemed not to constitute a permanent establishment, whether or not
that exception from permanent establishment status is contingent on the activity being of a
preparatory or auxiliary character, except to the extent that the relevant provision of the
Covered Tax Agreement provides explicitly that a specific activity shall be deemed not to
constitute a permanent establishment provided that the activity is of a preparatory or auxiliary
character;

20

b)

the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the
enterprise, any activity not described in subparagraph a), provided that this activity is of a
preparatory or auxiliary character;

c)

the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities
mentioned in subparagraphs a) and b), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of
business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.

4.
A provision of a Covered Tax Agreement (as it may be modified by paragraph 2 or 3) that lists
specific activities deemed not to constitute a permanent establishment shall not apply to a fixed place of
business that is used or maintained by an enterprise if the same enterprise or a closely related enterprise
carries on business activities at the same place or at another place in the same Contracting Jurisdiction and:
a)

that place or other place constitutes a permanent establishment for the enterprise or the closely
related enterprise under the provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement defining a permanent
establishment; or

b)

the overall activity resulting from the combination of the activities carried on by the two
enterprises at the same place, or by the same enterprise or closely related enterprises at the
two places, is not of a preparatory or auxiliary character,

provided that the business activities carried on by the two enterprises at the same place, or by the same
enterprise or closely related enterprises at the two places, constitute complementary functions that are part
of a cohesive business operation.
5.

6.

a)

Paragraph 2 or 3 shall apply in place of the relevant parts of provisions of a Covered Tax
Agreement that list specific activities that are deemed not to constitute a permanent
establishment even if the activity is carried on through a fixed place of business (or provisions
of a Covered Tax Agreement that operate in a comparable manner).

b)

Paragraph 4 shall apply to provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement (as they may be modified
by paragraph 2 or 3) that list specific activities that are deemed not to constitute a permanent
establishment even if the activity is carried on through a fixed place of business (or provisions
of a Covered Tax Agreement that operate in a comparable manner).

A Party may reserve the right:
a)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements;

b)

for paragraph 2 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that explicitly state that a list of
specific activities shall be deemed not to constitute a permanent establishment only if each of
the activities is of a preparatory or auxiliary character;

7.
Each Party that chooses to apply an Option under paragraph 1 shall notify the Depositary of its
choice of Option. Such notification shall also include the list of its Covered Tax Agreements which contain
a provision described in subparagraph a) of paragraph 5, as well as the article and paragraph number of
each such provision. An Option shall apply with respect to a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement only
where all Contracting Jurisdictions have chosen to apply the same Option and have made such a
notification with respect to that provision.

21

8.
Each Party that has not made a reservation described in subparagraph a) or c) of paragraph 6 and
does not choose to apply an Option under paragraph 1 shall notify the Depositary of whether each of its
Covered Tax Agreements contains a provision described in subparagraph b) of paragraph 5, as well as the

a Covered Tax Agreement only where all Contracting Jurisdictions have made a notification with respect
to that provision under this paragraph or paragraph 7.

Article 14 – Splitting-up of Contracts
1.
For the sole purpose of determining whether the period (or periods) referred to in a provision of a
Covered Tax Agreement that stipulates a period (or periods) of time after which specific projects or
activities shall constitute a permanent establishment has been exceeded:
a)

where an enterprise of a Contracting Jurisdiction carries on activities in the other Contracting
Jurisdiction at a place that constitutes a building site, construction project, installation project
or other specific project identified in the relevant provision of the Covered Tax Agreement, or
carries on supervisory or consultancy activities in connection with such a place, in the case of
a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement that refers to such activities, and these activities are
carried on during one or more periods of time that, in the aggregate, exceed 30 days without
exceeding the period or periods referred to in the relevant provision of the Covered Tax
Agreement; and

b)

where connected activities are carried on in that other Contracting Jurisdiction at (or, where
the relevant provision of the Covered Tax Agreement applies to supervisory or consultancy
activities, in connection with) the same building site, construction or installation project, or
other place identified in the relevant provision of the Covered Tax Agreement during different
periods of time, each exceeding 30 days, by one or more enterprises closely related to the
first-mentioned enterprise,

these different periods of time shall be added to the aggregate period of time during which the firstmentioned enterprise has carried on activities at that building site, construction or installation project, or
other place identified in the relevant provision of the Covered Tax Agreement.
2.
Paragraph 1 shall apply in place of or in the absence of provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement to
the extent that such provisions address the division of contracts into multiple parts to avoid the application

activities described in paragraph 1.
3.

A Party may reserve the right:

Arrangements and Similar Strategies), paragraph 4 of Article 13 (Artificial Avoidance of Permanent
Establishment Status through the Specific Activity Exemptions), or paragraph 1 of Article 14 (Splitting-up
of Contracts), a person is closely related to an enterprise if, based on all the relevant facts and
circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same persons or enterprises.
In any case, a person shall be considered to be closely related to an enterprise if one possesses directly or
indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, more
than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest
in the company) or if another person possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial
interest (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the

PART V.
IMPROVING DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Article 16 – Mutual Agreement Procedure
1.
Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting Jurisdictions result or
will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement,
that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those Contracting
Jurisdictions, present the case to the competent authority of either Contracting Jurisdiction. The case must
be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in
accordance with the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement.
2.
The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not
itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent
authority of the other Contracting Jurisdiction, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in
accordance with the Covered Tax Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented
notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting Jurisdictions.

agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Covered Tax
Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for
in the Covered Tax Agreement.

a)

b)

i)

The first sentence of paragraph 1 shall apply in place of or in the absence of provisions
of a Covered Tax Agreement (or parts thereof) that provide that where a person
considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting Jurisdiction result or will
result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Covered
Tax Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic
law of those Contracting Jurisdictions, present the case to the competent authority of
the Contracting Jurisdiction of which that person is a resident including provisions
under which, if the case presented by that person comes under the provisions of a
Covered Tax Agreement relating to non-discrimination based on nationality, the case
may be presented to the competent authority of the Contracting Jurisdiction of which
that person is a national.

ii)

The second sentence of paragraph 1 shall apply in place of provisions of a Covered Tax
Agreement that provide that a case referred to in the first sentence of paragraph 1 must
be presented within a specific time period that is shorter than three years from the first
notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of
the Covered Tax Agreement, or in the absence of a provision of a Covered Tax
Agreement describing the time period within which such a case must be presented.

i)

The first sentence of paragraph 2 shall apply in the absence of provisions of a Covered
Tax Agreement that provide that the competent authority that is presented with the case
by the person referred to in paragraph 1 shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to
be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the
case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting
Jurisdiction, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with
the Covered Tax Agreement.

Jurisdictions may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases
not provided for in the Covered Tax Agreement.

A Party may reserve the right:
a)

for the first sentence of paragraph 1 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements on the basis
that it intends to meet the minimum standard for improving dispute resolution under the
OECD/G20 BEPS Package by ensuring that under each of its Covered Tax Agreements (other
than a Covered Tax Agreement that permits a person to present a case to the competent
authority of either Contracting Jurisdiction), where a person considers that the actions of one
or both of the Contracting Jurisdictions result or will result for that person in taxation not in
accordance with the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement, irrespective of the remedies
provided by the domestic law of those Contracting Jurisdictions, that person may present the
case to the competent authority of the Contracting Jurisdiction of which the person is a
resident or, if the case presented by that person comes under a provision of a Covered Tax
Agreement relating to non-discrimination based on nationality, to that of the Contracting
Jurisdiction of which that person is a national; and the competent authority of that Contracting
Jurisdiction will implement a bilateral notification or consultation process with the competent
authority of the other Contracting Jurisdiction for cases in which the competent authority to
which the mutual agreement procedure case was presented does not consider the taxpayer’s
objection to be justified;

b)

for the second sentence of paragraph 1 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that do not
provide that the case referred to in the first sentence of paragraph 1 must be presented within a
specific time period on the basis that it intends to meet the minimum standard for improving
dispute resolution under the OECD/G20 BEPS package by ensuring that for the purposes of
all such Covered Tax Agreements the taxpayer referred to in paragraph 1 is allowed to present
the case within a period of at least three years from the first notification of the action resulting
in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement;

c)

for the second sentence of paragraph 2 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements on the
basis that for the purposes of all of its Covered Tax Agreements:
i)

any agreement reached via the mutual agreement procedure shall be implemented
notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of the Contracting Jurisdictions;
or

ii)

it intends to meet the minimum standard for improving dispute resolution under the

would have been attributable to the permanent establishment (this provision shall
not apply in the case of fraud, gross negligence or wilful default); and

B)

the Contracting Jurisdictions shall not include in the profits of an enterprise, and
tax accordingly, profits that would have accrued to the enterprise but that by
reason of the conditions referred to in a provision in the Covered Tax Agreement
relating to associated enterprises have not so accrued, after a period that is
mutually agreed between both Contracting Jurisdictions from the end of the
taxable year in which the profits would have accrued to the enterprise (this
provision shall not apply in the case of fraud, gross negligence or wilful default).

Each Party that has not made a reservation described in subparagraph a) of paragraph 5 shall
notify the Depositary of whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements contains a provision
described in clause i) of subparagraph a) of paragraph 4, and if so, the article and paragraph
number of each such provision. Where all Contracting Jurisdictions have made a notification
with respect to a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement, that provision shall be replaced by

supersede the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement only to the extent that those
provisions are incompatible with that sentence.

Agreement, as well as the article and paragraph number of each such provision; a
provision of a Covered Tax Agreement shall be replaced by the second sentence of
paragraph 1 where all Contracting Jurisdictions have made such a notification with

Article 17 – Corresponding Adjustments
1.
Where a Contracting Jurisdiction includes in the profits of an enterprise of that Contracting
Jurisdiction — and taxes accordingly — profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting
Jurisdiction has been charged to tax in that other Contracting Jurisdiction and the profits so included are
profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned Contracting Jurisdiction if the
conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between
independent enterprises, then that other Contracting Jurisdiction shall make an appropriate adjustment to
the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be
had to the other provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting
Jurisdictions shall if necessary consult each other.
2.
Paragraph 1 shall apply in place of or in the absence of a provision that requires a Contracting
Jurisdiction to make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on the profits of an
enterprise of that Contracting Jurisdiction where the other Contracting Jurisdiction includes those profits in
the profits of an enterprise of that other Contracting Jurisdiction and taxes those profits accordingly, and
the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of that other Contracting
Jurisdiction if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been
made between independent enterprises.
3.

A Party may reserve the right:
a)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements that already contain
a provision described in paragraph 2;

b)

for the entirety of this Article not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements on the basis that in
the absence of a provision referred to in paragraph 2 in its Covered Tax Agreement:

27

c)

i)

it shall make the appropriate adjustment referred to in paragraph 1; or

ii)

its competent authority shall endeavour to resolve the case under the provisions of a
Covered Tax Agreement relating to mutual agreement procedure;

in the case of a Party that has made a reservation under clause ii) of subparagraph c) of
paragraph 5 of Article 16 (Mutual Agreement Procedure), for the entirety of this Article not to
apply to its Covered Tax Agreements on the basis that in its bilateral treaty negotiations it
shall accept a treaty provision of the type contained in paragraph 1, provided that the
Contracting Jurisdictions were able to reach agreement on that provision and on the provisions
described in clause ii) of subparagraph c) of paragraph 5 of Article 16 (Mutual Agreement
Procedure).

4.
Each Party that has not made a reservation described in paragraph 3 shall notify the Depositary of
whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements contains a provision described in paragraph 2, and if so, the
article and paragraph number of each such provision. Where all Contracting Jurisdictions have made such
a notification with respect to a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement, that provision shall be replaced by
the provisions of paragraph 1. In other cases, paragraph 1 shall supersede the provisions of the Covered
Tax Agreement only to the extent that those provisions are incompatible with paragraph 1.

28

PART VI.
ARBITRATION
Article 18 – Choice to Apply Part VI
A Party may choose to apply this Part with respect to its Covered Tax Agreements and shall notify the
Depositary accordingly. This Part shall apply in relation to two Contracting Jurisdictions with respect to a
Covered Tax Agreement only where both Contracting Jurisdictions have made such a notification.

Article 19 – Mandatory Binding Arbitration
1.

Where:
a)

under a provision of a Covered Tax Agreement (as it may be modified by paragraph 1 of
Article 16 (Mutual Agreement Procedure)) that provides that a person may present a case to a
competent authority of a Contracting Jurisdiction where that person considers that the actions
of one or both of the Contracting Jurisdictions result or will result for that person in taxation
not in accordance with the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement (as it may be modified
by the Convention), a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting
Jurisdiction on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting Jurisdictions have
resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Covered Tax
Agreement (as it may be modified by the Convention); and

b)

the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to a
provision of a Covered Tax Agreement (as it may be modified by paragraph 2 of Article 16
(Mutual Agreement Procedure)) that provides that the competent authority shall endeavour to
resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting
Jurisdiction, within a period of two years beginning on the start date referred to in paragraph 8
or 9, as the case may be (unless, prior to the expiration of that period the competent authorities
of the Contracting Jurisdictions have agreed to a different time period with respect to that case
and have notified the person who presented the case of such agreement),

any unresolved issues arising from the case shall, if the person so requests in writing, be submitted to
arbitration in the manner described in this Part, according to any rules or procedures agreed upon by the
competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 10.
2.
Where a competent authority has suspended the mutual agreement procedure referred to in
paragraph 1 because a case with respect to one or more of the same issues is pending before court or
administrative tribunal, the period provided in subparagraph b) of paragraph 1 will stop running until either
a final decision has been rendered by the court or administrative tribunal or the case has been suspended or
withdrawn. In addition, where a person who presented a case and a competent authority have agreed to
suspend the mutual agreement procedure, the period provided in subparagraph b) of paragraph 1 will stop
running until the suspension has been lifted.
3.
Where both competent authorities agree that a person directly affected by the case has failed to
provide in a timely manner any additional material information requested by either competent authority
after the start of the period provided in subparagraph b) of paragraph 1, the period provided in
subparagraph b) of paragraph 1 shall be extended for an amount of time equal to the period beginning on

29

the date by which the information was requested and ending on the date on which that information was
provided.
4.

a)

The arbitration decision with respect to the issues submitted to arbitration shall be
implemented through the mutual agreement concerning the case referred to in paragraph 1.
The arbitration decision shall be final.

b)

The arbitration decision shall be binding on both Contracting Jurisdictions except in the
following cases:
i)

if a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that
implements the arbitration decision. In such a case, the case shall not be eligible for any
further consideration by the competent authorities. The mutual agreement that
implements the arbitration decision on the case shall be considered not to be accepted
by a person directly affected by the case if any person directly affected by the case does
not, within 60 days after the date on which notification of the mutual agreement is sent
to the person, withdraw all issues resolved in the mutual agreement implementing the
arbitration decision from consideration by any court or administrative tribunal or
otherwise terminate any pending court or administrative proceedings with respect to
such issues in a manner consistent with that mutual agreement.

ii)

if a final decision of the courts of one of the Contracting Jurisdictions holds that the
arbitration decision is invalid. In such a case, the request for arbitration under paragraph
1 shall be considered not to have been made, and the arbitration process shall be
considered not to have taken place (except for the purposes of Articles 21
(Confidentiality of Arbitration Proceedings) and 25 (Costs of Arbitration Proceedings)).
In such a case, a new request for arbitration may be made unless the competent
authorities agree that such a new request should not be permitted.

iii)

if a person directly affected by the case pursues litigation on the issues which were
resolved in the mutual agreement implementing the arbitration decision in any court or
administrative tribunal.

5.
The competent authority that received the initial request for a mutual agreement procedure as
described in subparagraph a) of paragraph 1 shall, within two calendar months of receiving the request:
a)

send a notification to the person who presented the case that it has received the request; and

b)

send a notification of that request, along with a copy of the request, to the competent authority
of the other Contracting Jurisdiction.

6.
Within three calendar months after a competent authority receives the request for a mutual
agreement procedure (or a copy thereof from the competent authority of the other Contracting Jurisdiction)
it shall either:
a)

notify the person who has presented the case and the other competent authority that it has
received the information necessary to undertake substantive consideration of the case; or

b)

request additional information from that person for that purpose.

7.
Where pursuant to subparagraph b) of paragraph 6, one or both of the competent authorities have
requested from the person who presented the case additional information necessary to undertake
30

substantive consideration of the case, the competent authority that requested the additional information
shall, within three calendar months of receiving the additional information from that person, notify that
person and the other competent authority either:
a)

that it has received the requested information; or

b)

that some of the requested information is still missing.

8.
Where neither competent authority has requested additional information pursuant to subparagraph b)
of paragraph 6, the start date referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the earlier of:
a)

the date on which both competent authorities have notified the person who presented the case
pursuant to subparagraph a) of paragraph 6; and

b)

the date that is three calendar months after the notification to the competent authority of the
other Contracting Jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph b) of paragraph 5.

9.
Where additional information has been requested pursuant to subparagraph b) of paragraph 6, the
start date referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the earlier of:
a)

the latest date on which the competent authorities that requested additional information have
notified the person who presented the case and the other competent authority pursuant to
subparagraph a) of paragraph 7; and

b)

the date that is three calendar months after both competent authorities have received all
information requested by either competent authority from the person who presented the case.

If, however, one or both of the competent authorities send the notification referred to in subparagraph b) of
paragraph 7, such notification shall be treated as a request for additional information under subparagraph
b) of paragraph 6.
10. The competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions shall by mutual agreement (pursuant to
the article of the relevant Covered Tax Agreement regarding procedures for mutual agreement) settle the
mode of application of the provisions contained in this Part, including the minimum information necessary
for each competent authority to undertake substantive consideration of the case. Such an agreement shall
be concluded before the date on which unresolved issues in a case are first eligible to be submitted to
arbitration and may be modified from time to time thereafter.
11. For purposes of applying this Article to its Covered Tax Agreements, a Party may reserve the right
to replace the two-year period set forth in subparagraph b) of paragraph 1 with a three-year period.
12. A Party may reserve the right for the following rules to apply with respect to its Covered Tax
Agreements notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article:
a)

any unresolved issue arising from a mutual agreement procedure case otherwise within the
scope of the arbitration process provided for by this Convention shall not be submitted to
arbitration, if a decision on this issue has already been rendered by a court or administrative
tribunal of either Contracting Jurisdiction;

b)

if, at any time after a request for arbitration has been made and before the arbitration panel has
delivered its decision to the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions, a decision

31

concerning the issue is rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of one of the Contracting
Jurisdictions, the arbitration process shall terminate.

Article 20 – Appointment of Arbitrators
1.
Except to the extent that the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions mutually agree on
different rules, paragraphs 2 through 4 shall apply for the purposes of this Part.
2.

The following rules shall govern the appointment of the members of an arbitration panel:
a)

The arbitration panel shall consist of three individual members with expertise or experience in
international tax matters.

b)

Each competent authority shall appoint one panel member within 60 days of the date of the
request for arbitration under paragraph 1 of Article 19 (Mandatory Binding Arbitration). The
two panel members so appointed shall, within 60 days of the latter of their appointments,
appoint a third member who shall serve as Chair of the arbitration panel. The Chair shall not
be a national or resident of either Contracting Jurisdiction.

c)

Each member appointed to the arbitration panel must be impartial and independent of the
competent authorities, tax administrations, and ministries of finance of the Contracting
Jurisdictions and of all persons directly affected by the case (as well as their advisors) at the
time of accepting an appointment, maintain his or her impartiality and independence
throughout the proceedings, and avoid any conduct for a reasonable period of time thereafter
which may damage the appearance of impartiality and independence of the arbitrators with
respect to the proceedings.

3.
In the event that the competent authority of a Contracting Jurisdiction fails to appoint a member of
the arbitration panel in the manner and within the time periods specified in paragraph 2 or agreed to by the
competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions, a member shall be appointed on behalf of that
competent authority by the highest ranking official of the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that is not a national of either Contracting
Jurisdiction.
4.
If the two initial members of the arbitration panel fail to appoint the Chair in the manner and within
the time periods specified in paragraph 2 or agreed to by the competent authorities of the Contracting
Jurisdictions, the Chair shall be appointed by the highest ranking official of the Centre for Tax Policy and
Administration of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that is not a national of
either Contracting Jurisdiction.

Article 21 – Confidentiality of Arbitration Proceedings
1.
Solely for the purposes of the application of the provisions of this Part and of the provisions of the
relevant Covered Tax Agreement and of the domestic laws of the Contracting Jurisdictions related to the
exchange of information, confidentiality, and administrative assistance, members of the arbitration panel
and a maximum of three staff per member (and prospective arbitrators solely to the extent necessary to
verify their ability to fulfil the requirements of arbitrators) shall be considered to be persons or authorities
to whom information may be disclosed. Information received by the arbitration panel or prospective
32

arbitrators and information that the competent authorities receive from the arbitration panel shall be
considered information that is exchanged under the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement related to
the exchange of information and administrative assistance.
2.
The competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions shall ensure that members of the
arbitration panel and their staff agree in writing, prior to their acting in an arbitration proceeding, to treat
any information relating to the arbitration proceeding consistently with the confidentiality and
nondisclosure obligations described in the provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement related to exchange
of information and administrative assistance and under the applicable laws of the Contracting Jurisdictions.

Article 22 – Resolution of a Case Prior to the Conclusion of the Arbitration
For the purposes of this Part and the provisions of the relevant Covered Tax Agreement that provide for
resolution of cases through mutual agreement, the mutual agreement procedure, as well as the arbitration
proceeding, with respect to a case shall terminate if, at any time after a request for arbitration has been
made and before the arbitration panel has delivered its decision to the competent authorities of the
Contracting Jurisdictions:
a)

the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions reach a mutual agreement to resolve
the case; or

b)

the person who presented the case withdraws the request for arbitration or the request for a
mutual agreement procedure.

Article 23 – Type of Arbitration Process
1.
Except to the extent that the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions mutually agree on
different rules, the following rules shall apply with respect to an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this
Part:
a)

After a case is submitted to arbitration, the competent authority of each Contracting
Jurisdiction shall submit to the arbitration panel, by a date set by agreement, a proposed
resolution which addresses all unresolved issue(s) in the case (taking into account all
agreements previously reached in that case between the competent authorities of the
Contracting Jurisdictions). The proposed resolution shall be limited to a disposition of specific
monetary amounts (for example, of income or expense) or, where specified, the maximum rate
of tax charged pursuant to the Covered Tax Agreement, for each adjustment or similar issue in
the case. In a case in which the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions have
been unable to reach agreement on an issue regarding the conditions for application of a
provision of the relevant Covered Tax Agreement (hereinafter referred to as a “threshold
question”), such as whether an individual is a resident or whether a permanent establishment
exists, the competent authorities may submit alternative proposed resolutions with respect to
issues the determination of which is contingent on resolution of such threshold questions.

b)

The competent authority of each Contracting Jurisdiction may also submit a supporting
position paper for consideration by the arbitration panel. Each competent authority that
submits a proposed resolution or supporting position paper shall provide a copy to the other
competent authority by the date on which the proposed resolution and supporting position
33

paper were due. Each competent authority may also submit to the arbitration panel, by a date
set by agreement, a reply submission with respect to the proposed resolution and supporting
position paper submitted by the other competent authority. A copy of any reply submission
shall be provided to the other competent authority by the date on which the reply submission
was due.
c)

The arbitration panel shall select as its decision one of the proposed resolutions for the case
submitted by the competent authorities with respect to each issue and any threshold questions,
and shall not include a rationale or any other explanation of the decision. The arbitration
decision will be adopted by a simple majority of the panel members. The arbitration panel
shall deliver its decision in writing to the competent authorities of the Contracting
Jurisdictions. The arbitration decision shall have no precedential value.

2.
For the purpose of applying this Article with respect to its Covered Tax Agreements, a Party may
reserve the right for paragraph 1 not to apply to its Covered Tax Agreements. In such a case, except to the
extent that the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions mutually agree on different rules, the
following rules shall apply with respect to an arbitration proceeding:
a)

After a case is submitted to arbitration, the competent authority of each Contracting
Jurisdiction shall provide any information that may be necessary for the arbitration decision to
all panel members without undue delay. Unless the competent authorities of the Contracting
Jurisdictions agree otherwise, any information that was not available to both competent
authorities before the request for arbitration was received by both of them shall not be taken
into account for purposes of the decision.

b)

The arbitration panel shall decide the issues submitted to arbitration in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Covered Tax Agreement and, subject to these provisions, of those
of the domestic laws of the Contracting Jurisdictions. The panel members shall also consider
any other sources which the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions may by
mutual agreement expressly identify.

c)

The arbitration decision shall be delivered to the competent authorities of the Contracting
Jurisdictions in writing and shall indicate the sources of law relied upon and the reasoning
which led to its result. The arbitration decision shall be adopted by a simple majority of the
panel members. The arbitration decision shall have no precedential value.

3.
A Party that has not made the reservation described in paragraph 2 may reserve the right for the
preceding paragraphs of this Article not to apply with respect to its Covered Tax Agreements with Parties
that have made such a reservation. In such a case, the competent authorities of the Contracting
Jurisdictions of each such Covered Tax Agreement shall endeavour to reach agreement on the type of
arbitration process that shall apply with respect to that Covered Tax Agreement. Until such an agreement is
reached, Article 19 (Mandatory Binding Arbitration) shall not apply with respect to such a Covered Tax
Agreement.
4.
A Party may also choose to apply paragraph 5 with respect to its Covered Tax Agreements and shall
notify the Depositary accordingly. Paragraph 5 shall apply in relation to two Contracting Jurisdictions with
respect to a Covered Tax Agreement where either of the Contracting Jurisdictions has made such a
notification.
5.
Prior to the beginning of arbitration proceedings, the competent authorities of the Contracting
Jurisdictions to a Covered Tax Agreement shall ensure that each person that presented the case and their

34

advisors agree in writing not to disclose to any other person any information received during the course of
the arbitration proceedings from either competent authority or the arbitration panel. The mutual agreement
procedure under the Covered Tax Agreement, as well as the arbitration proceeding under this Part, with
respect to the case shall terminate if, at any time after a request for arbitration has been made and before
the arbitration panel has delivered its decision to the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions,
a person that presented the case or one of that person’s advisors materially breaches that agreement.
6.
Notwithstanding paragraph 4, a Party that does not choose to apply paragraph 5 may reserve the
right for paragraph 5 not to apply with respect to one or more identified Covered Tax Agreements or with
respect to all of its Covered Tax Agreements.
7.
A Party that chooses to apply paragraph 5 may reserve the right for this Part not to apply with
respect to all Covered Tax Agreements for which the other Contracting Jurisdiction makes a reservation
pursuant to paragraph 6.

Article 24 – Agreement on a Different Resolution
1.
For purposes of applying this Part with respect to its Covered Tax Agreements, a Party may choose
to apply paragraph 2 and shall notify the Depositary accordingly. Paragraph 2 shall apply in relation to two
Contracting Jurisdictions with respect to a Covered Tax Agreement only where both Contracting
Jurisdictions have made such a notification.
2.
Notwithstanding paragraph 4 of Article 19 (Mandatory Binding Arbitration), an arbitration decision
pursuant to this Part shall not be binding on the Contracting Jurisdictions to a Covered Tax Agreement and
shall not be implemented if the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions agree on a different
resolution of all unresolved issues within three calendar months after the arbitration decision has been
delivered to them.
3.
A Party that chooses to apply paragraph 2 may reserve the right for paragraph 2 to apply only with
respect to its Covered Tax Agreements for which paragraph 2 of Article 23 (Type of Arbitration Process)
applies.

Article 25 – Costs of Arbitration Proceedings
In an arbitration proceeding under this Part, the fees and expenses of the members of the arbitration panel,
as well as any costs incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings by the Contracting
Jurisdictions, shall be borne by the Contracting Jurisdictions in a manner to be settled by mutual agreement
between the competent authorities of the Contracting Jurisdictions. In the absence of such agreement, each
Contracting Jurisdiction shall bear its own expenses and those of its appointed panel member. The cost of
the chair of the arbitration panel and other expenses associated with the conduct of the arbitration
proceedings shall be borne by the Contracting Jurisdictions in equal shares.

Article 26 – Compatibility
1.
Subject to Article 18 (Choice to Apply Part VI), the provisions of this Part shall apply in place of or
in the absence of provisions of a Covered Tax Agreement that provide for arbitration of unresolved issues
35

arising from a mutual agreement procedure case. Each Party that chooses to apply this Part shall notify the
Depositary of whether each of its Covered Tax Agreements, other than those that are within the scope of a
reservation under paragraph 4, contains such a provision, and if so, the article and paragraph number of
each such provision. Where two Contracting Jurisdictions have made a notification with respect to a
provision of a Covered Tax Agreement, that provision shall be replaced by the provisions of this Part as
between those Contracting Jurisdictions.
2.
Any unresolved issue arising from a mutual agreement procedure case otherwise within the scope of
the arbitration process provided for in this Part shall not be submitted to arbitration if the issue falls within
the scope of a case with respect to which an arbitration panel or similar body has previously been set up in
accordance with a bilateral or multilateral convention that provides for mandatory binding arbitration of
unresolved issues arising from a mutual agreement procedure case.
3.
Subject to paragraph 1, nothing in this Part shall affect the fulfilment of wider obligations with
respect to the arbitration of unresolved issues arising in the context of a mutual agreement procedure
resulting from other conventions to which the Contracting Jurisdictions are or will become parties.
4.
A Party may reserve the right for this Part not to apply with respect to one or more identified
Covered Tax Agreements (or to all of its Covered Tax Agreements) that already provide for mandatory
binding arbitration of unresolved issues arising from a mutual agreement procedure case.
